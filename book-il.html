        <h1>If Love</h1>
        <h3>Sweet but steamy New Adult romances.</h3>

        <h2>If We Ever Meet Again</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Forced proximity, Friends to lovers, Interracial, Opposites attract
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span></h3>
        <p>One year, two opposites, and a love that will blindside and, ultimately, shatter them. She's an aspiring interior designer who dreams 
            of falling in love. He's an ex-football star who thinks love is a con. She's a virgin, and he doesn't do virgins. He's cocky, 
            infuriating, and not her type. She wants the fairytale. He wants freedom. Blake and Farrah shouldn't have fallen for each other the 
            way they did: totally, completely, and irrevocably. Because they're studying abroad in Shanghai, and they only have one year. Because 
            forces at home threaten to rip them apart, even if they don't know it yet. And because, eventually, they must face the most 
            heartbreaking lesson they'll ever learn:  sometimes, even the greatest love can't conquer all.</p>

        <h2>If The Sun Never Sets</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Forced proximity, Interracial, Second chance
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span></h3>
        <p>Five years ago, he broke her heart. Now, he'll do anything to win her back. When Farrah walked into her lunch meeting, she didn't expect 
            to see him. Blake Ryan. Her first love, her first heartbreak, and now, her first client as a freelance interior designer. It's been 
            five years, but she'll never forget the way he shattered her. He whispers pretty words, but she'll never believe him. Her body craves 
            his, but she'll never give him her heart. Not again. Not ever.
            <br>***<br>
            Money. Looks. A booming sports bar empire. On the surface, Blake has it all, but inside, he's haunted—both by nightmares of a tragic 
            loss and dreams of the girl he once betrayed. When fate reunites them, he sees it as a sign: it's time to get the love of his life back.
            No matter what it takes.</p>

        <h2>If Love Had A Price</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Fake dating, Opposites attract, Rich heroine
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span>Explicit language, Explicit scenes</h3>
        <p>Every heart has a price. She offered him $10,000 to seduce her father's gold-digging fiancée. He countered with $15,000 and a kiss—from 
            her. At any time he chose. Kris should've said no, but she was desperate to get rid of her stepmother-to-be, and the gorgeous actor with 
            the wicked grin was perfect for the job. So she agreed to his terms—not knowing that doing so would cost her a lot more than money and a kiss…
            <br>***<br>
            He did it for the money—which he desperately needed. The kiss was just a bonus—or so he told himself. Melting an ice princess like Kris 
            started as a challenge, but by the time Nate realized there was more to Kris than meets the eye, it was too late: he had fallen. But they're 
            not just from opposite sides of the track—they're from different worlds. And when those worlds collide, Kris and Nate must decide whether 
            they're willing to give up what they have for what could be…</p>
            <p class="extra">This is book three of the If Love series but can be read as a complete standalone. Chronologically, it takes place between 
                books one (If We Ever Meet Again) and two (If the Sun Never Sets).</p>

        <h2>If We Were Perfect</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Asian romance, Forced proximity, Roommates, Second chance
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span></h3>
        <p>Two exes, one house. What could go wrong? Olivia had a plan: MBA, Wall Street VP by thirty-two, marriage and two children (preferably 
            twins because #efficiency). Not in her plan? Losing half her belongings in an apartment flood and being forced to turn to her ex for 
            help. Definitely not in her plan? Moving into said ex's house and watching him walk around shirtless, bake her cupcakes, and look at 
            her with those smoldering— Wait, what was she talking about again?
            <br>***<br>
            Between his bakery and meddling family, Sammy had enough on his plate without bringing the ex he'd never been able to forget into the 
            mix. But when Olivia asks for his help, he couldn't say no. He could, however, make her regret breaking his heart—as long as he doesn't 
            do anything foolish, like sneak into her room and kiss her senseless… As passion slowly replaces their dislike for each other, Sammy and 
            Olivia discover their past isn't what it seems and their future is anything but certain. Can they overcome their pride and give love a 
            second chance, or is history doomed to repeat itself?</p>
            <p class="extra">Can be read as a standalone.</p>
