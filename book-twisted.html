        <p>He has a heart of ice…but for her, he'd burn the world. Alex Volkov is a devil blessed with the face of an angel and cursed with a 
            past he can't escape. Driven by a tragedy that has haunted him for most of his life, his ruthless pursuits for success and vengeance 
            leave little room for matters of the heart. But when he's forced to look after his best friend's sister, he starts to feel something 
            in his chest: A crack. A melt. A fire that could end his world as he knew it.
            <br>***<br>
            Ava Chen is a free spirit trapped by nightmares of a childhood she can't remember. But despite her broken past, she's never stopped 
            seeing the beauty in the world…including the heart beneath the icy exterior of a man she shouldn't want. Her brother's best friend. 
            Her neighbor. Her savior and her downfall. Theirs is a love that was never supposed to happen—but when it does, it unleashes secrets 
            that could destroy them both…and everything they hold dear.</p>

        <h2>Twisted Games</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Age gap, Bodyguard, Forbidden romance, Forced proximity, Rich heroine, Royalty
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span>Gun violence, Child abuse, Death, Drug overdose, Explicit sexual content, Profanity</h3>
        <p>She can never be his…but he's taking her anyway. Stoic, broody, and arrogant, elite bodyguard Rhys Larsen has two rules:
            <br>1) Protect his clients at all costs
            <br>2) Do not become emotionally involved. Ever.
            <br>He has never once been tempted to break those rules…until her. Bridget von Ascheberg. A princess with a stubborn streak that 
            matches his own and a hidden fire that reduces his rules to ash. She's nothing he expected and everything he never knew he needed.
            Day by day, inch by inch, she breaks down his defenses until he's faced with a truth he can no longer deny: he swore an oath to 
            protect her, but all he wants is to ruin her. Take her. Because she's his. His princess. His forbidden fruit. His every depraved fantasy.
            <br>***<br>
            Regal, strong-willed, and bound by the chains of duty, Princess Bridget dreams of the freedom to live and love as she chooses. But when 
            her brother abdicates, she's suddenly faced with the prospect of a loveless, politically expedient marriage and a throne she never wanted.
            And as she navigates the intricacies—and treacheries—of her new role, she must also hide her desire for a man she can't have. Her bodyguard. 
            Her protector. Her ultimate ruin. Unexpected and forbidden, theirs is a love that could destroy a kingdom…and doom them both.</p>

        <h2>Twisted Hate</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Best friend's brother, Enemies to lovers, Forced proximity, Interracial
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span>Abusive parents, Blackmail, Dead parent, Death, Stalking, Sexual Harrasment, Mildly dubious consent (one scene)</h3>
        <p>He hates her…almost as much as he wants her. Gorgeous, cocky, and fast on his way to becoming a hotshot doctor, Josh Chen has never met a 
            woman he couldn't charm—except for Jules f**king Ambrose. The beautiful redhead has been a thorn in his side since they met, but she also 
            consumes his thoughts in a way no woman ever has. When their animosity explodes into one unforgettable night, he proposes a solution 
            that'll get her out of his system once and for all: an enemies with benefits arrangement with simple rules. No jealousy. No strings 
            attached. And absolutely no falling in love.
            <br>***<br>
            Outgoing and ambitious, Jules Ambrose is a former party girl who's focused on one thing: passing the attorney's bar exam. The last thing 
            she needs is to get involved with a doctor who puts the SUFFER in insufferable…no matter how good-looking he is. But the more she gets 
            to know him, the more she realizes there's more than meets the eye to the man she's hated for so long. Her best friend's brother. Her 
            nemesis. And her only salvation. Theirs is a match made in hell, and when the demons from their past catch up with them, they're faced 
            with truths that could either save them …or destroy everything they've worked for.</p>

        <h2>Twisted Lies</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Billionaire, Fake dating, Forced proximity, Morality chain, Neighbors, Roommates
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span>Anxiety, Alzheimer's, Death, Graphic Violence, Stalking, Suicide, Kidnap, Emotional abuse</h3>
        <p>He'll do anything to have her…including lie. Charming, deadly, and smart enough to hide it, Christian Harper is a monster dressed in the 
            perfectly tailored suits of a gentleman. He has little use for morals and even less use for love, but he can't deny the strange pull he 
            feels toward the woman living just one floor below him. She's the object of his darkest desires, the only puzzle he can't solve. And 
            when the opportunity to get closer to her arises, he breaks his own rules to offer her a deal she can't refuse. Every monster has their 
            weakness. She's his. His obsession. His addiction. His only exception.
            <br>***<br>
            Sweet, shy, and introverted despite her social media fame, Stella Alonso is a romantic who keeps her heart in a cage. Between her two 
            jobs, she has little time or desire for a relationship. But when a threat from her past drives her into the arms—and house—of the most 
            dangerous man she's ever met, she's tempted to let herself feel something for the first time in a long time. Because despite Christian's 
            cold nature, he makes her feel everything when she's with him. Passionate. Protected. Truly wanted. Theirs is a love twisted with secrets 
            and tainted by lies…and when the truths are finally revealed, they could shatter everything. </p>
