        <h1>Gods Of The Game</h1>
        <h3>Steamy sports romances set in the world of English Premier League football (aka soccer).</h3>

        <h2>The Striker</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes:</span> Sports, Brother's rival, Forced proximity
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings:</span> Car Accident, Death of loved one</h3>
        <p>She's the only woman he wants…and the only one he can't have. Asher Donovan is a living legend—the darling of the Premier League, 
            the (arguably) greatest footballer in the world. But his reckless antics and recent team transfer have caused much controversy, and 
            when his feud with his rival-turned-teammate costs them a championship, they're forced to “bond” during off-season cross-training. 
            Surviving the summer shouldn't be hard…until Asher meets their new trainer. She's beautiful, talented, and no matter how hard he tries, 
            he can't take his mind off her. The only problem? She's his rival's sister—and completely off limits.
            <br>***<br>
            Scarlett DuBois is a former prima ballerina whose career was cut short by a tragic accident. Now a teacher at a prestigious dance academy 
            but still haunted by the ghosts of her past, the last thing she wants is to spend the summer cross-training Asher Donovan, of all people. 
            She swore she would never date a footballer, but when her brother leaves town for an emergency, she finds herself thrown into dangerously 
            close proximity with the gorgeous, charming striker. Training, she can deal with. But falling in love? That's out of the question—especially
            when he's the only person with the power to break her heart.</p>

        <h2>The Defender</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes:</span> Sports
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings:</span> Break-in, Abandonment, Violence, Attempted murder</h3>
        <p>He has to play by the rules…but for her, he'd break them all. As the captain of Blackcastle Football Club and one of the highest-paid athletes 
            in the game, Vincent DuBois should be on top of the world. But when his fame brings danger to his doorstep, he finds himself in his worst 
            nightmare scenario—secretly sharing a flat with his coach's daughter, knowing full well she's far too big a temptation for him to resist. When 
            his new living arrangements escalate into a bet that throws them even closer together, he realizes he's in deeper trouble than he thought. He's 
            always played to win—but for her, he might just risk it all.
            <br>***<br>
            As a sports nutritionist and the daughter of a legendary coach, Brooklyn Armstrong is used to dealing with hotshot athletes. However, no player 
            gets under her skin like Vincent, her best friend's infuriatingly cocky (and gorgeous) brother. She left California hoping for a fresh start, 
            and he's the kind of distraction she doesn't need. Now, he's sleeping in the room next to hers while her career is up in the air and her defenses 
            are crumbling. But no matter how many sparks fly between them, a relationship between the captain and the coach's daughter could never work…could it?</p>
