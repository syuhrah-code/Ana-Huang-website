        <h1>King Of Sin</h1>
        <h3>Steamy billionaire romances themed around the seven deadly sins.</h3>
        <div class="indiv-books">

        <h2>King Of Wrath</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Arranged marriage, Billionaire, Dislike to love, Forced proximity, Interracial, Rich heroine, Roommates
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span>Blackmail, Death of loved one, Emotional abuse, Robbery at gunpoint, Abandonment</h3>
        <p>She's the wife he never wanted…and the weakness he never saw coming. Ruthless. Meticulous. Arrogant. Dante Russo thrives on control, 
            both personally and professionally. The billionaire CEO never planned to marry—until the threat of blackmail forces him into an 
            engagement with a woman he barely knows. Vivian Lau, jewelry heiress and daughter of his newest enemy. It doesn't matter how beautiful 
            or charming she is. He'll do everything in his power to destroy the evidence and their betrothal. There's only one problem: now 
            that he has her…he can't bring himself to let her go.
            <br>***<br>
            Elegant. Ambitious. Well-mannered.<br>
            Vivian Lau is the perfect daughter and her family's ticket into the highest echelons of high society. Marrying a blue-blooded Russo 
            means opening doors that would otherwise remain closed to her new-money family. While the rude, elusive Dante isn't her idea of a 
            dream partner, she agrees to their arranged marriage out of duty. Craving his touch was never part of the plan. Neither was the 
            worst thing she could possibly do: fall in love with her future husband.</p>

        <h2>King Of Pride</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span> Asian romance, Billionaire, Forbidden romance, Opposites attract
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span>Blackmail, Cancer</h3>
        <p>She's his opposite in every way…and the greatest temptation he's ever known. Reserved, controlled, and proper to a fault, Kai Young 
            has neither the time nor inclination for chaos—and Isabella, with her purple hair and inappropriate jokes, is chaos personified. With 
            a crucial CEO vote looming and a media empire at stake, the billionaire heir can't afford the distraction she brings. Isabella is 
            everything he shouldn't want, but with every look and every touch, he's tempted to break all his rules…and claim her as his own.
            <br>***<br>
            Bold, impulsive, and full of life, Isabella Valencia has never met a party she doesn't like or a man she couldn't charm…except for Kai Young.
            It shouldn't matter. He's not her type—the man translates classics into Latin for fun, and his membership at the exclusive club where she 
            bartends means he's strictly off limits. But she can't deny that, beneath his cool exterior, is a man who could make her melt with just a 
            touch. No matter how hard they try, they can't resist giving into their forbidden desires. Even if it costs them everything.</p>

        <h2>King Of Greed</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Billionaire, Marriage in trouble, Second chance
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span>Death, Violence, Child abandonement/abuse</h3>
        <p>He had her, he lost her…and he'll do anything to win her back. Powerful, brilliant, and ambitious, Dominic Davenport clawed his way up 
            from nothing to become the King of Wall Street. He has everything—a beautiful home, a beautiful wife, and more money than he could 
            spend in a lifetime. But no matter how much he accumulates, he's never satisfied. In his endless quest for MORE, he drives away the 
            only person who saw him as enough. It isn't until she's gone that he realizes there may be more to life than riches and glory…but by 
            then, it may be too late. 
            <br>***<br>
            Kind, intelligent, and thoughtful, Alessandra Davenport has played the role of trophy wife for years. She stood by her husband while 
            he built an empire, but now that they've reached the top, she realizes he's no longer the man she fell for. When it becomes clear that 
            she'll always come second to his work, she finally takes charge of her life and puts herself first—even if it means leaving the only 
            man she's ever loved. But what she didn't count on was his refusal to let her go…or for him to fight for their marriage, no matter what it takes.</p>

        <div class="text">
        <h2>King Of Sloth</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Billionaire, Forced proximity, Grumpy sunshine, He falls first, Interracial
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span>Cheating (not by MCs), Parent death, Emotional abuse, CFS</h3>
        <p>He'd never wanted anyone enough to chase them...until he met her. Charming, easygoing, and rich beyond belief, Xavier Castillo has the 
            world at his fingertips. He also has no interest in taking over his family's empire (much to his father's chagrin), but that hasn't 
            stopped women from throwing themselves at him…unless the woman in question is his publicist. Nothing brings him more joy than riling 
            her up, but when a tragedy forces them closer than ever, he must grapple with the uncertainty of his future—and the realization that 
            the only person immune to his charms is the only one he truly wants.  
            <br>***<br>
            Cool, intelligent, and ambitious, Sloane Kensington is a high-powered publicist who's used to dealing with difficult clients. However, 
            none infuriate—or tempt—her more than a certain billionaire heir, with his stupid dimples and laid-back attitude. She may be forced 
            to work with him, but she'll never fall for him…no matter how fast he makes her heart beat or how thoughtful he is beneath his party 
            persona. He's her client, and that's all he'll ever be. Right?</p>

        <h2>King Of Envy</h2>
        <h3><span>Tropes: </span>Billionare
        <br><span>Trigger Warnings: </span>SA, Murder, Torture, Arson, Financial abuse</h3>
        <p>He had everything he could've wanted…except her. Dangerous. Powerful. Reclusive. Vuk Markovic is notorious for shunning human interactions. 
            The scarred billionaire rarely talks, and he has no interest in relationships outside his small but trusted circle. His only exception? 
            Her. The beauty to his beast, the object of his obsession. He saw her first. He wanted her first. But now, she's engaged to his oldest 
            friend—and the closer the wedding looms, the more he's torn between loyalty and desire. She should be his…and he might just risk it all 
            to have her.
            <br>***<br>
            Beautiful. Successful. Glamorous. To the world, supermodel Ayana Kidane leads the perfect life. Her career has skyrocketed, and she's 
            engaged to one of New York's most eligible bachelors. What people don't know is that the engagement is only a business arrangement. He 
            gets his inheritance when they marry; she gets the money she needs to leave her abusive agency. Pretending to be in love should be 
            easy—until she finds herself increasingly drawn to her fiancé's enigmatic best man. Vuk thrills and terrifies her in equal measure. 
            She knows she should stay away, but when her wedding is thrown into chaos, he's the only person she finds comfort in… Until his past 
            catches up with them and threatens everything they love.</p>
