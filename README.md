This project is an author website featuring a landing page, complete book list, dedicated pages for each book series, author information, and upcoming news. It showcases both UI/UX design principles and front-end web development through a responsive, data-driven implementation. <br>
The initial website originally began as a school project focused on web design and basic HTML and CSS. Original requirements consisted of a landing page, author information page, and a gallery, all conceptualized in Adobe XD and made in Dreamweaver. <br>
After starting a full-stack developer course on Scrimba, I wanted to challenge myself and expand the project using new skills and knowledge I gained. I redesigned the website on Figma and executed in with VS Code, now complete with additional pages, improved structure, and interactive functionality. <br>
Key features include a responsive multi-page layout with a hamburger menu thats mobile-first navigation and expands to a desktop navigation bar, a redesigned UI with improved user flow and navigation, JavaScript powered animations and interactions, advanced CSS layout technique and animation. I even made dedicated pages for individual book series with book data stored in a centralized JSON which was then dynamically rendered. <br>
Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JSON. <br>
This project has helped me understand how static designs can translate into interactive user experiences, and how using structured data-such as JSON as my single source of truth- improves maintainability and avoid future bugs when new books and series are added. <br>
Challenges include designing a scalable JSON structure for multiple books and series, as well as refactoring a previously static website into a data-driven structure. <br>
There are still many areas where this project can be improved and expanded that I plan to revisit in the future. This includes implementing a filtering functionality using JavaScript's ".filter()" and ".map()" to allow users to select specific tropes and exclude certain trigger warnings, made possible by the centralized JSON data. I can also enhance accessibility and keyboard navigation.
